# Paramine

This was started as a small hobby project to extract data for [Paragon](https://www.epicgames.com/paragon) by Epic Games.

It was found useful by some community members, so I decided to upload it here for everyone to enjoy.

## Feedback / Discussion

Feel free to join the [Paramine discord](https://discord.gg/GHgcJqK) to discuss things and ask questions.

## About

Epic is already providing Hero data but you need to ask for an API key, and it was found to contain some errors in the past (caused by some post-processing by Epic).  
The data in this repository is guaranteed to be accurate as it is directly extracted from the game files.   
It also contains some not published information about existing and not released heroes and features.

Note that Epic has the possibility to deploy "server-side" micro patches that I can't (yet ?) account for, but so far this only happened in small exceptional cases.

## Donate
